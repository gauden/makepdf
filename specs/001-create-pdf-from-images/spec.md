# Feature Specification: PDF Concatenation Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-pdf-from-images`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a Python package and executable command line tool that will accept a directory path as an argument or a string of pathnames to individual images and PDF files. If it receives a directory as argument, it will identify all the images and PDF files in that directory, one level down (not conducting a recursive search). Once it has a list of valid pathnames, the app will concatenate them into a single PDF file. The output filename will be an optional input argument, otherwise it will simply create "./output.pdf" in the current directory. Another optional argument will be `--start <filename.pdf>`. If the --start argument exists, the other files will be appended to the start file."

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: If the output PDF file already exists, how should the tool behave? → A: Prompt the user for confirmation before overwriting.
- Q: What should happen if an input file is not a valid image or PDF? → A: Skip the invalid file and print a warning message.
- Q: Besides PDF, which specific image formats must be supported? → A: JPG, JPEG, PNG, TIFF
- Q: What is the expected behavior when the input directory is empty? → A: Print a message indicating that the directory is empty.
- Q: What should happen if the input directory does not exist? → A: Use the current directory and inform the user.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to be able to combine multiple images and PDF files into a single PDF file so that I can easily share them.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a directory containing images and PDF files, **When** I run the tool with the directory path, **Then** a single PDF file is created containing all the images and PDF files from that directory.
2. **Given** a list of image and PDF file paths, **When** I run the tool with the list of paths, **Then** a single PDF file is created containing all the specified images and PDF files.
3. **Given** an output filename, **When** I run the tool with the output filename argument, **Then** the output PDF file is created with the specified name.
4. **Given** a starting PDF file, **When** I run the tool with the `--start` argument, **Then** the other files are appended to the astarting PDF file.

### Edge Cases
- If the input directory is empty, the tool MUST print a message indicating that the directory is empty.
- If the specified input directory does not exist, the tool MUST use the current directory and inform the user.
- If an input file is not a valid image or PDF, the tool MUST skip it and print a warning message.
- If the output file already exists, the tool MUST prompt the user for confirmation before overwriting.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The tool MUST accept a directory path as an argument.
- **FR-002**: The tool MUST accept a list of individual image and PDF file paths as arguments.
- **FR-003**: The tool MUST identify all image and PDF files in the specified directory (one level deep).
- **FR-004**: The tool MUST support the following image formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, TIFF.
- **FR-005**: The tool MUST concatenate the identified files into a single PDF file.
- **FR-006**: The tool MUST allow specifying an output filename.
- **FR-007**: If no output filename is specified, the tool MUST create a file named `output.pdf` in the current directory.
- **FR-008**: The tool MUST allow specifying a starting PDF file to which other files will be appended.
- **FR-009**: The tool MUST handle invalid input gracefully and provide informative error messages.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **PDF Document**: The final output file.
- **Input File**: An image or PDF file to be included in the final document.
