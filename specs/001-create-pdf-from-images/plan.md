# Implementation Plan: PDF Concatenation Tool

**Branch**: `001-create-pdf-from-images` | **Date**: 2025-09-25 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/gauden/dev/makepdf/specs/001-create-pdf-from-images/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This feature will be a Python package and command-line tool called `makepdf`. It will take a list of image and PDF files, or a directory, and concatenate them into a single PDF. The user can specify the output filename and a starting PDF to append to.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: PyPDF2, Pillow
**Storage**: Filesystem
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: Must be installable via pip/uv.
**Scale/Scope**: N/A

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Code Quality**: The code will be written to be clear, maintainable, and well-documented, following PEP8 standards.
- **II. Testing Standards**: A comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests will be developed, aiming for at least 80% code coverage.
- **III. User Experience Consistency**: The CLI will have a consistent and predictable interface.
- **IV. Performance Requirements**: N/A

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
- No major unknowns that require research.

**Output**: research.md

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- **Data Model**: No complex data model is required for this feature.
- **API Contracts**: This is a CLI tool, so no API contracts are needed.
- **Quickstart**: A `quickstart.md` will be created to demonstrate how to use the tool.

**Output**: data-model.md, quickstart.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks for setting up the Python package, implementing the CLI, and writing tests.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation

**Estimated Output**: 10-15 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [X] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [X] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)

**Gate Status**:
- [X] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [ ] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [X] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
