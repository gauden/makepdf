# Feature Specification: Remove FFmpeg Conversion

**Feature Branch**: `004-remove-ffmpeg-conversion`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Remove ffmpeg conversion -- remove dependcy completely even as optional, remove the relevant specs, code, tests, and make any edits to the documentation as necessary"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want the `makepdf` application to no longer include FFmpeg conversion capabilities, so that the application is lighter and does not have FFmpeg as a dependency.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is installed, **when** I check the dependencies, **then** FFmpeg and any related libraries are not present.
2. **Given** the application is installed, **when** I attempt to use a feature that previously relied on FFmpeg, **then** the feature is either removed or gracefully handles the absence of FFmpeg without errors.
3. **Given** the application's documentation, **when** I read about conversion features, **then** all mentions of FFmpeg and its conversion capabilities are removed.

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: Are there any other conversion features (e.g., image format conversion) that should also be considered for removal or modification, or is the scope strictly limited to FFmpeg-related video conversion? ‚Üí A: All ffmpeg functionality is to be removed.

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: Are there any other conversion features (e.g., image format conversion) that should also be considered for removal or modification, or is the scope strictly limited to FFmpeg-related video conversion? ‚Üí A: All ffmpeg functionality is to be removed.
- Q: If a user attempts to use a feature that previously relied on FFmpeg, should the application: ‚Üí A: Silently ignore the request and proceed without the FFmpeg-dependent functionality.
- Q: How should the system handle existing user configurations or scripts that might still reference FFmpeg or its conversion capabilities? ‚Üí A: Log a warning and continue, assuming the user will manually update.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a user tries to convert a video file after FFmpeg is removed? The application should silently ignore the request.
- How does the system handle existing configurations that might reference FFmpeg? The system should log a warning and continue, assuming the user will manually update.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The application MUST completely remove FFmpeg as a dependency, including any optional references. This includes all FFmpeg-related functionality.
- **FR-002**: All code related to FFmpeg conversion MUST be removed.
- **FR-003**: All tests related to FFmpeg conversion MUST be removed.
- **FR-004**: All documentation (specs, README, etc.) mentioning FFmpeg conversion MUST be updated or removed.
- **FR-005**: The application MUST continue to function correctly for its core purpose (concatenating images and PDFs) without FFmpeg.
