# Feature Specification: Package for Easy Installation

**Feature Branch**: `003-package-the-program`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Package the program for easy installation across systems. Use hatchling as it works well with uv. I want to be able to do `uv tool install makepdf` for installation and all related commands for upgrading and uninstalling."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to easily install, upgrade, and uninstall `makepdf` using `uv tool` so that I can manage the application with standard command-line tools.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** `uv` is installed, **When** I run `uv tool install makepdf`, **Then** the `makepdf` command becomes available in my shell.
2. **Given** `makepdf` is installed, **When** I run `uv tool uninstall makepdf`, **Then** the `makepdf` command is no longer available.
3. **Given** an older version of `makepdf` is installed, **When** I run `uv tool install --upgrade makepdf`, **Then** the `makepdf` command is updated to the latest version.


## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: What should be the behavior if the `uv tool install makepdf` command fails due to system permissions? ‚Üí A: Attempt to request elevated permissions (e.g., `sudo`) from the user.
- Q: Are there any specific versions of Python that makepdf should support? ‚Üí A: 3.9 upwards
- Q: Should the package be published to a public registry like PyPI, or is it for private use only? ‚Üí A: Keep the package private for internal use. (User note: "Private for now; publish later")
- Q: Should there be any performance constraints on the installation, such as a maximum installation time? ‚Üí A: No, there are no strict performance constraints for installation.
- Q: What level of logging should be implemented for the installation process? ‚Üí A: Basic: Log only success or failure of the installation.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user does not have `uv` installed?
- How does the system handle installation failures (e.g., due to permissions)? If the installation fails due to permissions, the system will attempt to request elevated permissions from the user.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST be packageable into a standard Python distribution.
- **FR-002**: The packaging process MUST use `hatchling` as the build backend.
- **FR-003**: The packaged application MUST be installable using `uv tool install makepdf`.
- **FR-004**: The installed application MUST be upgradeable using `uv tool install --upgrade makepdf`.
- **FR-005**: The installed application MUST be uninstallable using `uv tool uninstall makepdf`.
- **FR-006**: The packaged application MUST support Python 3.9 and newer versions.
- **FR-007**: The package MUST NOT be published to a public registry at this time.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: There are no strict performance constraints for installation time.
- **NFR-002**: The installation process MUST log the success or failure of the installation.
