# makepdf Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code must be clear, maintainable, and well-documented. Code should be written to be easily understood by other developers.

### II. Testing Standards
All new features must be accompanied by a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests. A minimum of 80% code coverage is required for all new code.

### III. User Experience Consistency
The user experience should be consistent across all parts of the application. UI components and workflows should be reused whenever possible.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The application must be performant and responsive. All new features must be benchmarked to ensure they do not introduce performance regressions.

## Development Workflow

All new work must begin with a clear specification and design document. All code must be peer-reviewed before being merged into the main branch.

## Review Process

All code reviews must be thorough and constructive. Reviewers should focus on code quality, correctness, and adherence to the principles outlined in this constitution.

## Governance

This constitution is the supreme governing document for this project. All other practices and guidelines must be consistent with it. Amendments to this constitution require a formal proposal, review, and approval process.
